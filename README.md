# Vulnerability Diff Action

[![CI](https://github.com/sec-open/vuln-diff-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/sec-open/vuln-diff-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

GitHub Action to **compare vulnerabilities between two refs (branches, tags, commits)** using [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) and [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype).  

Generates an **SBOM (CycloneDX JSON)** for each ref, scans it with Grype, and produces a **diff of vulnerabilities**:
- Markdown table (sorted by severity)  
- JSON payload with detailed results  
- Counts of new, removed, and unchanged vulnerabilities  

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Detect new vulnerabilities introduced by a branch/PR  
- Optional build step before scanning (e.g., `mvn package`)  
- Filter vulnerabilities by minimum severity (`LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL`)  
- Output as GitHub summary, workflow outputs, and downloadable artifact  
- Designed for multi-repo and monorepo setups (`path` input)  
- Future: GitHub PR comments, Checks API, and Slack notifications

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Compare two refs manually

```yaml
name: Manual Vulnerability Diff

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      base:
        description: "Base ref (e.g. main)"
        required: true
      head:
        description: "Head ref (e.g. feature/x)"
        required: true

jobs:
  vuln-diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with: { fetch-depth: 0 }

      - name: Vulnerability Diff
        id: diff
        uses: sec-open/vuln-diff-action@main
        with:
          base_ref: ${{ inputs.base }}
          head_ref: ${{ inputs.head }}
          build_command: "mvn -q -DskipTests package"
          min_severity: "LOW"
          write_summary: "true"

      - name: Outputs
        run: |
          echo "NEW=${{ steps.diff.outputs.new_count }}"
          echo "REMOVED=${{ steps.diff.outputs.removed_count }}"
          echo "UNCHANGED=${{ steps.diff.outputs.unchanged_count }}"
